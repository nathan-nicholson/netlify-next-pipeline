# Nathan's Next.js on Netlify Platform Starter

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/02ec8e71-b01b-49a2-88f9-70e018945df2/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/netlify-next-pipeline-example/deploys)

A modern starter based on Next.js 14 (App Router), Tailwind, daisyUI, and [Netlify Core Primitives](https://docs.netlify.com/core/overview/#develop) (Edge Functions, Image CDN, Blob Store).

In this site, Netlify Core Primitives are used both implictly for running Next.js features (e.g. Route Handlers, image optimization via `next/image`, and more) and also explicitly by the user code.

Implicit usage means you're using any Next.js functionality and everything "just works" when deployed - all the plumbing is done for you. Explicit usage is framework-agnostic and typically provides more features than what Next.js exposes.

## Deploying to Netlify

This repo uses a GitHub Actions workflow and the Netlify CLI to build and deploy to Netlify instead of leveraging Netlify's continuous deployment functionality. This can be helpful for orchestrating other build steps or for more complex deployment workflows.

## Developing Locally

1. Clone this repository, then run `npm install` in its root directory.

2. For the starter to have full functionality locally (e.g. edge functions, blob store), please ensure you have an up-to-date version of Netlify CLI. Run:

```
npm install netlify-cli@latest -g
```

3. Link your local repository to the deployed Netlify site. This will ensure you're using the same runtime version for both local development and your deployed site.

```
netlify link
```

4. Then, run the Next.js development server via Netlify CLI:

```
netlify dev
```

If your browser doesn't navigate to the site automatically, visit [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888).
